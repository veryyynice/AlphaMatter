# 🤖 Project Alpha: AI-Powered Study Hub for UWB

Welcome to **Project Alpha**, a research-driven initiative by [[GDG UWB](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-on-campus-university-of-washington-bothell-bothell-united-states/)
 in collaboration with **Professor Peng Du**, focused on building an intelligent, AI-powered study assistant for University of Washington Bothell (UWB) students.

---

## 🧠 What is Project Alpha?

**Project Alpha** aims to create an AI-integrated chatroom and study platform that:
- 📚 Answers course-specific questions using **LLMs + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- 👨‍🏫 Pulls verified answers directly from lecture notes, slides, and course material
- 🤝 Facilitates collaborative study between classmates
- ⏰ Supports 24/7 student assistance across UWB courses

---

## 🔬 Research Backing

This project is closely tied to ongoing research by **Professor Peng Du** on human-centered AI systems, contextual learning environments, and trustworthy large language models (LLMs).

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

Many UWB students struggle to find fast, reliable answers outside lecture hours. Our tool makes it easier to:
- Catch up on missed material
- Get clarification on hard topics
- Study together with smart support
